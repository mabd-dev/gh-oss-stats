# Release Notes - v0.2.1

**Release Date:** December 24, 2025
**Codename:** Documentation & UX Improvements

## 📋 Overview

Version 0.2.1 is a documentation and user experience release that makes gh-oss-stats more accessible to GitHub users who want to add contribution badges to their profiles. This release includes no code changes—all improvements focus on documentation clarity, organization, and ease of use.

## ✨ What's New

### Complete Documentation Reorganization

The documentation has been restructured to better serve two distinct audiences:

1. **GitHub Users** - Want to add badges to their profiles quickly
2. **Developers** - Need technical details for CLI/library usage

### New Sample Workflow File

Added `.github/workflows/generate-oss-badge-sample.yaml` - a production-ready GitHub Actions workflow that users can copy directly to their profile repositories. Features:
- Auto-updates badge weekly (customizable)
- Creates output directory automatically
- No token setup required (uses built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- Ready to use with zero configuration

### Improved Main README

**New Focus:** GitHub profile badge integration (primary use case)

**Changes:**
- **New tagline:** "Showcase your open source contributions with auto-updating GitHub profile badges"
- **Benefit-driven description:** Emphasizes what users get (badges) instead of how it works (JSON output)
- **Reordered features:** Leads with badges and automation, not technical details
- **Quick Start section:** Step-by-step guide for adding badges to GitHub profiles
- **Better customization docs:** Clear examples for changing styles, themes, and schedules
- **Developer section:** Makes it clear the tool is also a full-featured CLI/library

### New Technical Documentation

Created `docs/TECHNICAL.md` with comprehensive technical details:
- **Installation:** Multiple methods (go install, build from source)
- **CLI Usage:** All flags with examples
- **Debug Mode:** Local testing without GitHub API
- **Library Usage:** Go package examples
- **Output Format:** JSON schema and examples
- **Prerequisites:** Token setup and alternatives
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions
- **Architecture:** Code organization overview
- **Development:** Testing, building, and contributing

### Enhanced Badge Gallery

Updated `docs/badges/README.md` (renamed from `docs/BADGES.md`):
- More visual examples for all 4 styles × 2 themes
- Use case recommendations for each style
- Better organization and formatting
- Real-world integration examples

### Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

Added extensive troubleshooting section in `docs/TECHNICAL.md`:

**Covered Issues:**
- "No contributions found" - Causes and solutions
- "Rate limit exceeded" - Token setup and debug mode
- "Workflow fails with directory not found" - Path configuration
- "Badge not updating in profile" - Permissions and caching
- "Authentication failed" - Token validation
- "Badge shows old data" - Browser and CDN caching

Each issue includes:
- Possible causes
- Step-by-step solutions
- Prevention tips

### Debug Mode Documentation

Added full documentation for the `--debug` flag (introduced in v0.2.0 but undocumented):

```bash
# Fast local testing with mock data (no token required)
gh-oss-stats --user test-user --debug

# Generate badge from mock data
gh-oss-stats --user test-user --debug --badge --badge-output test-badge.svg
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No API rate limits
- ✅ Instant results (<1 second)
- ✅ No GitHub token required
- ✅ Uses static mock data
- ✅ Perfect for development and CI testing
